/// The Mudbase SDK's generated Api classes (AuthenticationApi, DataApi, ...) call

/// the Authorization header (see Mudbase.Sdk.Api.DataApi's generated method bodies). The SDK's own
/// DI wiring (HostConfiguration.AddTokens + UseProvider) is built for a single static token
/// registered once at startup — fine for a server-to-server API key, wrong for this app, where
/// every browser session carries its own Mudbase JWT (anonymous guest or customer) that changes
/// over the app's lifetime across many concurrent users.
///
/// This provider closes over IHttpContextAccessor instead of a fixed token, so each call resolves
/// whichever JWT is stored in *that request's* session at the moment the SDK asks for one — safe
/// to register as a singleton (as UseProvider&lt;,&gt;() requires) because IHttpContextAccessor
/// itself is singleton-safe, reading the ambient HttpContext via AsyncLocal rather than storing
/// per-instance state.
