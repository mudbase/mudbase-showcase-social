/// session, not just a signed-in customer's writes (see `SessionStore` doc comments: an anonymous
/// session's token pair carries the same refresh contract as a real one, confirmed in the SDK —
/// `CreateAnonymousSession200Response` has its own `refreshToken`). Every collection read/write in
/// `CollectionsGateway` and every bucket/file call in `ImageUploadService` routes through
/// `perform(_:)` for exactly this reason.
///
/// This is an `actor`, not a plain struct, because the platform's refresh token is single-use (it
/// rotates on every `/api/auth/refresh` call — see `AuthGateway.refresh`). If two authenticated
/// calls each hit a 401 at nearly the same moment (e.g. the feed's poll loop and a like toggle
/// racing at token expiry), they must not both redeem the same stored refresh token — the second
/// redeem would fail against an already-rotated token. `inFlightRefresh` de-duplicates that race
/// into a single refresh call that every concurrent 401 awaits together. Ported verbatim from the
/// ecommerce Swift port's `Networking/AccessTokenCoordinator.swift`.
